# Customizable Items
A top-down twin-stick shooter developed in Unity. The main gimmick is the ability to mix and match different "triggers" and "effects" to create your own custom passive effects (e.g [When enemy is below 50% health] + [Drop a grenade at their location]). Additionally, there are extra z-dimensional levels despite being a 2D game, this has proven to be a huge pain and I regret nothing.
An old project gradually developed over 3 years, currently in hiatus.
